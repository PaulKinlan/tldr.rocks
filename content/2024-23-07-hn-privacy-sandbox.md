### Article summary

Here's a summary of the blog post:

Google is proposing a new approach for the Privacy Sandbox initiative on the web. Instead of completely deprecating third-party cookies, they plan to introduce a new experience in Chrome that allows users to make an informed choice about cookie tracking that applies across their web browsing. Users will be able to adjust this choice at any time.

Key points:

- The goal remains to improve online privacy while preserving ad-supported internet and a competitive marketplace.

- Google has received feedback from various stakeholders including regulators, publishers, developers, and advertisers throughout the process.

- Early testing shows the Privacy Sandbox APIs have potential to achieve desired outcomes.

- Google will continue to make Privacy Sandbox APIs available and invest in improving them.

- They plan to introduce additional privacy controls like IP Protection in Chrome's Incognito mode.

- Google will continue consulting with regulators like the UK's CMA and ICO as they finalize this approach.

- The company expressed gratitude to all organizations and individuals who have contributed to developing and testing the Privacy Sandbox over the last four years.

The post emphasizes that this new approach aims to elevate user choice while still providing privacy-preserving alternatives for developers and advertisers. Google plans to engage with the industry as they roll out this new path forward for online privacy and advertising.
