Here is a summary of the key sentiments and recommendations from the Hacker News post:

## Positive Sentiment

- Some acknowledge the legitimate use case of preventing fraud and bots.
- A few note that not all devices need full attestation, and it could be limited to high security services like banking.
- Google does provide good Linux support in Chrome, so they may not intend to block Linux users.

## Negative Sentiment 

- Majority express concerns about loss of user privacy, freedom and control.
- Many predict it will block alternative OSes like Linux and custom Android ROMs. 
- Commenters worry it will kill the open web and force users onto locked down corporate OSes.
- Some believe it is mainly intended to block ad blockers.
- Multiple comments criticize the power and control of big tech companies behind this.

## Recommend Actions

- Allow users to opt out or use less strict attestation for normal browsing.
- Clarify that Linux/open source OSes will not be blocked from general web access. 
- Provide transparency on what properties the attestation checks for.
- Get feedback from privacy advocacy groups before standardizing.
- Consider tying attestation to a separate hardware token instead of full device checks.
