 Here is a summary of the Hacker News post in Markdown format:

### Positive Sentiment

- The post introduces new web APIs that enable building advanced web apps, like using system level contact picker, saving files directly to disk, accepting file uploads etc. This will allow developing full-featured web apps that rival native apps.

- `showSaveFilePicker()` provides a better user experience than just downloading a file, since it allows editing and incrementally saving a file. 

- Being able to retain file access permissions between sessions is a useful upcoming feature.

### Negative Sentiment

- The APIs have poor browser support currently. A browser compatibility matrix should have been provided.

- The file access APIs may be unexpected and seem unnatural to users. Clear user prompts need to be shown when accessing user files.

- Some feel web apps should not try to replace native apps and traditional editors.

### Recommended Actions

- Provide a browser compatibility matrix to inform developers.

- Educate users on how file access works, show clear prompts before accessing user files.

- Prioritize user control, privacy and security as these powerful web APIs roll out.
