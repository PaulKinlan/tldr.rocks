Part of my job is to understand the conversations that are happenging in the web 
development industry and synthesise the sentiment so that the teams in the company 
I work at can get a quick.

It can take a long time to parse the comment threads and form an opinion about how 
the discussion went. It turns out that there are tools that can parse the content of 
page and quickly synthesise the main points of discussion.

This site is the output of that work so that it if you don't have the time to read it
all then you can get the gist of what happened.
