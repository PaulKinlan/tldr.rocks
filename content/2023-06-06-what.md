Welcome to TL;DR Rocks!

This is a simple site that has a summary of the conversations on social sites like hackernews.

The summary is autogenerated via Machine Learning model and then tweaked after to provide a human crafted narrative on top of it.

Currently the best responses are generated by [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai). The prompt used is as follows:

```
[Insert a copy of all the comments from the Hacker News post here]
Summarize this Hacker News post.

The output should be in Markdown and have three sections: Positive Sentiment; Negative Sentiment; Recommend actions to address the feedback.

Extract up to 5 of the most relevant links to external content that are in the text and add them to an "Interesting links" section. Do not include malformed URLs.
```
