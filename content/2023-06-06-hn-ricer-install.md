Based on the Hacker News thread you provided, here is a summary of the discussion surrounding the new installation pop-up for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) on Chrome:

+ The distinction between a Chrome app and a webpage is very minimal, leading to questions about the value of this new feature. Some users wonder why there's a need for a screenshot of the app/webpage already in use
+ Some users suggest this pop-up could be useful for non-technical users, and for avoiding the use of Electron. Electron is a framework used to create desktop apps using web technologies, but each Electron app is essentially a Chrome browser. By using Chrome as the base for these apps, there would be no need for multiple copies of Electron on a system, saving resources. However, some counter-arguments mention that Electron has certain platform hooks that Chrome doesn't currently support
+ The screenshot of the app is seen as useful by some because it doesn't include elements such as newsletter sign-up modals, cookie banners, or ads that might be present on the actual webpage
+ There is a discussion about the potential goal of Google to have the browser become an app store for "webapp desktop apps." However, some users argue that most people might not want to "install" web apps on their desktops
+ There are differing opinions on the usability and utility of web apps versus native apps. Some users prefer the functionality and user experience of web apps and dislike the idea of PWAs emulating native apps. They argue that PWAs sometimes sacrifice basic web capabilities in an attempt to mimic native apps. Others, however, enjoy the cleaner UI that comes with removing the browser chrome and appreciate the opportunity to use operating system window/app management functions
+ There is a discussion about the accessibility and discoverability of the installation process for PWAs. Some users argue that it is currently too difficult to find the install button for these apps. They suggest that if Chrome wants this feature to succeed, they need to make the UI more accessible
+ A point was made that IT departments might be interested in this feature as it could enable them to create an internal app store for installing web apps, indicating that this feature might be useful for device managers, not just end users
+ There was some confusion about Chrome deprecating "apps" in 2020, but it was clarified that Chrome Apps and PWAs are different. Chrome Apps were a proprietary Chrome-specific type of Chrome Extension, while PWAs are based on open web standards and have support in multiple browsers. Chrome Apps were effectively obsoleted by PWAs
