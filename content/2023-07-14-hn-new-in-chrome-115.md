Here is a summary of the key sentiments and recommendations from the Hacker News post:

## Positive Sentiment

- Some commenters think the Topics API is an improvement over third-party cookies for preserving privacy while still allowing relevant ads. They see it as a pragmatic approach given Google's business model.

- A few commenters appreciate Google's intent with the new APIs like Fenced Frames and Shared Storage, even if the implementations may have issues.

- There is optimism WebGPU will come to Linux in Chrome soon.

## Negative Sentiment 

- Many commenters see the Topics API as just another form of tracking and are very distrustful of Google's motives with it. They want the ability to fully opt out.

- Some think Fenced Frames undermine privacy protections like third-party cookie isolation. There is concern advertisers could abuse this.

- Frustration with certain scroll-based web animations that are seen as annoying rather than enhancing the experience.

- Dismay that Chrome is adding more proprietary APIs rather than supporting open web standards.

## Recommendations

- Allow users to fully opt out of tracking like the Topics API if they want to. Make it very clear how to do this.

- Carefully vet how Fenced Frames could be misused by advertisers and close any loopholes. Err on the side of privacy protection.

- Consider only introducing scroll animations that genuinely improve UX, not just for flair. Respect user preferences.

- Try to leverage open standards rather than proprietary APIs where possible. Collaborate with other browser vendors.
