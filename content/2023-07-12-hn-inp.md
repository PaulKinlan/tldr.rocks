Here is a summary of the key points from the Hacker News post:

## Positive Sentiment

- Google's efforts to improve web performance are appreciated. INP could help incentivize better practices.
- Client-side rendering can make interactions feel faster compared to full page reloads.
- Fast initial response times after clicks are good for usability.

## Negative Sentiment 

- INP may encourage premature loaders before requests start. This could be misleading.
- Google's own scripts like Analytics are problematically heavy and hurt scores. 
- The metrics may be too strict for many sites to reach. Standards feel dictated by Google.
- Small sites suffer from issues on a few pages affecting all pages.

## Recommended Actions

- Provide more guidance and tools to help developers understand and address INP issues.
- Optimize heavy Google scripts like Analytics to have less performance impact. 
- Consider adjustments to INP grading thresholds based on real world data.
- Look into tweaking how site-wide scores are calculated from sample pages.
