Here is a summary of the sentiment and recommended actions:

### Positive Sentiment

- INP aims to improve app responsiveness, which enhances user experience.
- Client-side rendering enables faster post-load interactions.
- 200ms threshold seems reasonable for overall human responsiveness.

### Negative Sentiment 

- Concerns that skeleton screens could "game" the INP metric.
- Google analytics bloat causes poor scores, presenting a conflict of interest.
- Lack of transparency on how metrics impact search rankings. 
- Server-side rendering argued to be faster by some.
- 200ms threshold considered too high by some given network latency.
- Complaints that Google is dictating how websites should be built.

### Recommended Actions

- Investigate techniques to detect and prevent gaming of INP metric.
- Optimize Google analytics scripts and advocate lighter weight analytics. 
- Provide more transparency on how metrics are used in ranking algorithms.
- Research server-side vs. client-side rendering performance tradeoffs.
- Explain rationale behind 200ms INP threshold selection. 
- Clarify that Google recommendations are optional best practices, not requirements.
