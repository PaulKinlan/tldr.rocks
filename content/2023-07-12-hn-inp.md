Here are a few key points from the Hacker News discussion on Next Paint Interaction (INP):

INP measures the time from a user interaction like clicking to the next paint, aiming to capture app responsiveness. Some see it as a useful metric, while others worry it incentivizes "gaming" with skeleton screens.

Many blame Google's own tools like analytics and tag manager for poor INP scores. This highlights the conflict of interest of Google promoting performance while also providing heavyweight analytics.

Some question if improving Web Vitals scores like INP actually impacts search rankings, since Google's algorithm changes frequently. There's debate on whether focusing on these metrics really matters.

There's discussion around server-side vs client-side rendering. Some argue server-side is faster, while others say client-side enables quicker interactions once loaded.

Some critique INP's "good" threshold of 200ms as too high, given average network latency. But others argue it's reasonable for measuring overall human responsiveness.

There are complaints about Google dictating how websites should be built. But also defense that Google isn't requiring anyone to follow their recommendations.
