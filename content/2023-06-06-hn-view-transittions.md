The post appears to be a discussion about transitions between two Document Object Model (DOM) states. The main sentiment appears to be mixed, with several themes emerging:

+ Explanation and Clarification: Some users seek to clarify the functionality of the new feature, explaining that it allows for transitions between two DOM states without needing to keep something in the DOM during an animation. There's also a discussion about whether or not this approach is typical of native platform view transitions, with some disagreement over its implementation in iOS and MacOS.
+ Comparisons to Existing Technologies: Some users compared this feature to existing technologies like WPF and HTML/CSS, with varying opinions on the relative merits and demerits of each. One user also drew a comparison to PowerPoint page transitions supported by IE5.
+ Potential Applications and Limitations: Users expressed curiosity about potential applications of this feature, with one user speculating about whether this feature might still be relevant by the time it becomes stable enough to use.
+ User Experience with Transitions: The discussion also touched on user experiences with transitions, leading to a debate about the merits of animations and transitions in user interfaces. Some users felt that heavy usage of transitions can lead to dizziness​1​, while others disagreed, arguing that when implemented well, transitions can make navigation more intuitive. Some users also expressed frustration with how transitions can slow things down, especially for power users.
+ Potential Solutions and Workarounds: Some users offered potential solutions to mitigate the effects of transitions, such as adjusting accessibility settings.
+ Given the technical nature of the post, the sentiment often aligns with individuals' experiences, preferences, and understanding of the technology. While some are excited about the possibilities, others are more skeptical, offering criticisms based on their experiences or understanding of user interface design and user experience.
